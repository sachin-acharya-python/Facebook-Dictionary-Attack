# Facebook Bruteforce
__________________
This repository is private so anyone by any chance got access to this repository and misusing the program enlisted here, I will not be responsible (not that this program's working fine). If you are using, use for educational purpose only. 

This is a simple application that can bruteforce-attack facebook using any wordlist that are provided. I created this program just to learn something new.

### Installation
You can install all the required packages using pip. _(Note: This program requires python version to be more that 3)._  

In Linux you can install `Python`, and `PIP` using following command.
````bash
sudo apt-get install git python3 python3-pip
````
For windows, you can download python from this link [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After downloading and installing `python`, `python-pip` clone this repository and navigate to the cloned directory.  
After navigating to cloned directory, run the following command in terminal/shell/cmd/powershell.
```cmd
pip install requirements.txt
```

__You are done with installation...__

### Usage
Run following command to execute the script.
```cmd
python FacebookForce.py [-w wordlist.txt]
```

_(Note: [-w wordlist.txt] is unnecessary unless you are trying to pass your own wordlist file. If so omit square bracket.)_  
**Do as it prompts**
